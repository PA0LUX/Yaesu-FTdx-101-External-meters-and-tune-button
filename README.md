# Yaesu-FTdx-101-External-meters-and-tune-button
How to build an Arduino driven external meter display with a tune button for a Yaesu FTdx-101.
With special thanks to John, G4BEH for his contributions.

Note: There are 2 sketches in the download. One is named FTdx-101D....and the other is named FTdx101MP....
Be sure to use the correct file for your radio, otherwise some of the scales will be incorrect.

This is a design of an Arduino (Nano) with a 2.8â€œ TFT acting as a simultaneous (bargraph-)display of all 9 meters available in the FTdx-101.

It reads all meter settings from the radio via CAT, through the Rs232 connector. 
The display will also show what power has been set in the radio. Besides that, it has a (momentary) pushbutton that can be used to tune the radio with 20 Watts (adjustable in .ino file).
The following data are displayed:

- SWR
- Comp
- Temp
- IDD
- VDD
- ALC
- S Main - is substituted by Power out when in TX,  S Main is set to OFF when receiver is off.
- S Sub  -  is set to OFF when receiver is off.
-Power out - instead of S Main, when in TX
 
- Present power setting
- Connection status

At tune button press, it stores the present power setting and the present mode. It will then engage an FM-N transmission. 
When released, the tuning signal will stop. The present power setting is restored after the button has been released. The tune power can be adapted in the sketch with the variable; set_tune_pwr "PC020;" The 020 means 20W. You can change it to anything between 005 and 100.
